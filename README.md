# Operators in C++
## Aim
We learn about different operator and operations in C++.
## Theory
In C++, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They can be broadly categorized into arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and miscellaneous operators. `Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)` handle basic mathematical operations. `Relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)` compare values and return a boolean result. `Logical operators (&&, ||, !)` are used for logical operations, while `bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)` operate on bits. `Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)` assign values to variables. Additionally, C++ supports increment (++), decrement (--), and conditional (?:) operators, as well as operators for memory management (new, delete) and type casting. Operator overloading allows developers to define custom behaviors for operators when applied to user-defined types, enhancing the language's flexibility. Understanding operators is crucial for effective programming, as they form the foundation of expression and control flow in C++.
